I enjoy building things that meet real world use cases while maintaining solid foundations, creating principled software. I earned a BA in philosophy from UNM, studying formal logic and the philosophy of beauty. In 2015 I took a [full-stack development bootcamp](https://deepdivecoding.com/fullstack/) where I was introduced to programming. At that time, my goals were simple: build a website. Over the course of the program and the past two years I developed a profound love of programming and computer science.

I started working as a web developer in 2016 and paired my experience in business and marketing with newfound technical skill to create solutions for our clients. One year later, our web development shop morphed into a single-product startup where I contributed to application development in Python and React. 

I currently work as a Software Engineer at [Xpansiv Data Systems](https://www.xpansiv.com/). 

My favorite languages are Haskell and C. However I frequently work with Python, Java, SQL, and JavaScript (jQuery, React, Redux).

When Iâ€™m not at a computer, I enjoy reading, gardening, and watching Star Trek. You can usually find me in the backyard with my five chickens.
