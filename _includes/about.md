I thrive on building things, both logical and artful, and excel in the space between the two. I am pursuing a M.Sc. in computer science at the University of New Mexico (UNM) in Albuquerque, where I focus on software engineering and have found an interest in data science. Prior to that, I earned a BA in philosophy from UNM, studying formal logic and the philosophy of beauty. In 2015 I took a [full-stack development bootcamp](https://deepdivecoding.com/fullstack/) where I was formally introduced to programming. At that time, my goals were simple: build a website. Yet, only a few short weeks in, I knew I had found a passion much bigger than my original goals. 

In the following months I fell in love with software development. I started working as a web developer in 2016 and paired my experience in business and marketing with newfound technical skill to create solutions for our clients. One year later, our web development shop morphed into a single-product startup where I contributed to application development in Python and React. 

The descision to go to graduate school came easily when I realized I wanted a deeper, more fundamental understanding of computer science. I didn't just want to be a programmer, I wanted to participate in solving larger problems. I also became interested in working with large data sets and finding better ways to understand and visualize data. 

Some languages I frequently work with include Python, Java, C, HTML5, CSS3/SASS, JavaScript (jQuery, React, Redux), and SQL.

When Iâ€™m not at a computer, I enjoy reading, gardening, and watching Star Trek. You can usually find me in the backyard with my five chickens.
